# metro_population
This Python script presents a UI that allows you to retrieve Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) population data from the US Census API, store it in an AWS Postgres database, and read / visualize the data.  This is intended to help learn the basics of Python, API requests, and interaction with cloud hosted databases.
